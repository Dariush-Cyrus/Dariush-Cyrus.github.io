I’ve updated my research profile to highlight my ongoing interests in Theoretical Physics and Lattice QCD. My experience with these fundamental frameworks—particularly in handling complex computational models and non-perturbative phenomena—forms the backbone of my approach to solving intricate problems in nuclear science and fluid perturbation theory.

My foundation remains rooted in Theoretical Physics. I find that the rigorous mathematical discipline required for QCD simulations provides a unique advantage when calculating first-order quantum corrections for applications. It's all about understanding the fundamental forces to predict real-world behavior.

## Why publish notebooks?

> [!TIP]
> **Reproducible Research**: By publishing the actual notebook, you allow others to download and run your code, verifying your results and building upon your work.

- **No more screenshots** – Render crisp code and vector plots directly from your source.
- **Theme consistent** – Notebooks automatically adapt to your site's theme (including dark mode).
- **Flexible sourcing** – Display notebooks from your `assets/` folder, page bundles, or even directly from a remote GitHub URL.
- **Interactive** – Users can copy code blocks or download the full notebook to run locally.

## Example: Data Science Workflow

Below is a live example of a notebook rendered right here in this post. Notice how the markdown, code, and outputs (text, HTML, and JSON) are all preserved and styled.

{{< notebook
    src="hugoblox-onboarding.ipynb"
    title="Launch Readiness Analysis"
    show_metadata=true
    line_numbers=true
    dense=false
    download_label="Download notebook"
    show_outputs=true
>}}

## How to add a notebook

1. **Save your notebook.** Place your `.ipynb` file in `assets/notebooks/` (for global access) or inside a page bundle (like `content/blog/my-post/analysis.ipynb`).
2. **Add the shortcode.** In any Markdown page, simply use:
   `{{</* notebook src="analysis.ipynb" */>}}`
3. **Customize.** You can hide code cells for non-technical audiences (`show_code=false`) or just show the output (`show_outputs=true`).

> Hugo Blox respects your privacy. Notebook rendering happens statically at build time—no third-party services required.

## Next steps

- **Try it out:** Drop one of your existing notebooks into this site and see how it looks.
- **Link your papers:** Use the Embed shortcode to link your notebook to your latest arXiv preprint or GitHub repository.
- **Get help:** Join the community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) or check the [documentation](https://docs.hugoblox.com).

Happy researching! 🚀
