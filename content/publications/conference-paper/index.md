abstract: The fluid perturbation theory is a good choice for calculating the equation of state (EOS) of binary mixture at wide range of
temperature and pressure. The constituent spices are considered to be interacting via a pair potential consisting of short range repulsion
and a long rang attraction which has been included through a Buckinghamexp-6. andܶ arelightelementstherefore,thequantumeffect
is included via first order quantum correction in the frame work of Wigner-Kirkwood expansion. In this article we have used an advanced type of EOS. We have been studied the effect of different values of pressure and temperature on the properties of fluid mixture
based on statistical mechanical perturbation theory. Finally, the EOS of ൅ ܶ fluid mixtures has been predicted over a wide range of pressure and temperature in reduced density.
