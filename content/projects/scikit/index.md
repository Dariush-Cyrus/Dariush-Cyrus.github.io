Context: Master's Thesis at Umea University.
 * Description: Developed complex computational models to study the linear and non-linear properties of plasma. I designed and executed Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations using C++ and Fortran to analyze dynamic system behavior.
 * Key Tech: C++, Fortran, PIC Simulation, Python (Data Visualization)..
