bio: |
  Darius Azimi Highly analytical Physicist with a robust foundation in 
  Theoretical, Nuclear, and Plasma Physics. With a career spanning 
  multiple M.Sc. degrees from top Swedish and Iranian institutions, I 
  specialize in bridging the gap between complex theoretical frameworks
  and practical computational applications. My expertise lies in 
  developing high-fidelity simulations—using PIC, Monte Carlo, and 
  Molecular Dynamics—to investigate the linear and non-linear properties 
  of dynamic physical systems. ​I am a published author in journals such 
  as the International Journal of Modern Physics B, where I have 
  contributed to the understanding of statistical physics, binary hard 
  sphere mixtures, and quantum perturbation theory. By combining rigorous 
  mathematical modeling with advanced software development in C++,
  Fortran, and Python, I deliver high-quality analytical solutions for 
  complex equations using iterative solvers like GMRES and BICGSTAB.
  Whether driving academic research or consulting on technical nuclear 
  systems, I am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of applied physics 
  through algorithmic innovation and data-driven insights.
